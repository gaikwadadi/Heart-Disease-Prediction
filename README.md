# Heart Disease Prediction Model

This project implements a **Heart Disease Prediction System** using multiple supervised machine learning models.  
It predicts the presence of heart disease based on patient health data.

## 📋 Project Overview

- **Objective:**  
  Predict the presence of heart disease using medical attributes.

- **Dataset:**  
  Heart Disease Dataset — includes various patient health metrics.

## 🔍 Approach

✅ Data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature scaling  
✅ Cross-validation for robust evaluation  
✅ Trained and compared multiple models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest
  - Naive Bayes

✅ Evaluated models using standard classification metrics
